              It is characterized by a combination of symptoms that can vary widely, making diagnosis and management complex. PCOS impacts an estimated 10% of people assigned female at birth worldwide, making it a significant health concern.PCOS can cause hormonal imbalances, irregular periods, excess androgen levels and cysts in the ovaries. Irregular periods, usually with a lack of ovulation, can make it difficult to become pregnant. PCOS is a leading cause of infertility.

              PCOS is a chronic condition and cannot be cured. However, some symptoms can be improved through lifestyle changes, medications and fertility treatments.

              The cause of PCOS is unknown but women with a family history or type 2 diabetes are at higher risk.

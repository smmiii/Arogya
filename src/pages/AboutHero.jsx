Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal condition that affects women of reproductive age. It usually starts during adolescence, but symptoms may fluctuate over time. 
  
  PCOS can cause hormonal imbalances, irregular periods, excess androgen levels, and cysts in the ovaries. Irregular periods, usually with a lack of ovulation, can make it difficult to become pregnant. PCOS is a leading cause of infertility.
  
  PCOS is a chronic condition and cannot be cured. However, some symptoms can be improved through lifestyle changes, medications, and fertility treatments.
  
  The cause of PCOS is unknown but women with a family history or type 2 diabetes are at higher risk.`;
